Puzzle: Can you get to the beach before the shark gets there? 

## Puzzle

![picture](picture.png)

* You are on a circular island.
* There is a smart hungery shark that can swim 4 times faster than you can run. 
* You can see his position (and he can see yours).

Can you get to the beach before he gets there?
You're lazy. What's the shortest distance you need to run to get there?

## Background

Another great puzzle posed by DSK.
Suppose the island radius is 1 unit. Running straight away from the shark's starting position won't work. It's &pi; distance for the shark (1/2 circumference) and &pi;/4 < 1.

So you need to be more clever!
